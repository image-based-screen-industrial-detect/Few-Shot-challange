
<h1>Few-shot Industrial Screen Defect Detection Challenge 2025</h1>

<p>Industrial screens are critical components in a wide range of electronics and machinery. However, defects during manufacturing can severely impact performance and usability. Identifying these defects, especially in a few-shot setting with limited annotated examples, remains a significant challenge.</p>

<p>This competition encourages the development of innovative few-shot object detection methods for accurately localizing and classifying defects on industrial screens. Participants will be provided with a small number of labeled images for training and a large unlabeled set for evaluation.</p>

<p>The goal is to achieve the highest possible mean Average Precision (mAP@0.95) on the hidden test set.</p>
